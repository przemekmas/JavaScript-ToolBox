# JavaScript Toolbox

The JavaScript toolbox has been created to provide a tool which can be used to design a simple website. The main reason I have created this toolbox is to learn about JavaScript and how it can be used to create HTML components dynamically which can be moved around and modified by the user.

### Additional Notes

* This is a very simple website which has been created for educational purposes. Please feel free to fork this repository and improve it.
